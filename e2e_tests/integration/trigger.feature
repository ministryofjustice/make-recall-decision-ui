  Scenario: Countersignature status is correct for PO after they have filled in Part A task list
    Given a PO has created a recommendation to recall with:
      | Indeterminate  | No  |
      | Extended       | No       |
    And PO has requested an SPO to review recommendation
    And SPO has visited the review link
    And SPO has recorded a review decision of RECALL
    When PO logs back in to update Recommendation
    And PO creates a Part A form with:
      | RecallType          | STANDARD |
      | InCustody           | No  |
      | VictimContactScheme | No           |
    Then the PO task-list has the following status:
      | LineManagerSignature   | To do            |
      | SeniorManagerSignature | Cannot start yet |

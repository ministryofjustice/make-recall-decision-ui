  Scenario Outline: E2E - SPO records rationale during review and countersigns Part A later
    Given a PO has created a recommendation to recall with:
      | Indeterminate  | <Indeterminate>  |
      | Extended       | <Extended>       |
      | TypeOfSentence | <TypeOfSentence> |
    And PO has requested an SPO to review recommendation
    And SPO has visited the review link
    And SPO has recorded a review decision of <SPODecision>
    And PO logs back in to update Recommendation
    And PO creates a Part A form with:
      | RecallType          | <RecallType> |
      | InCustody           | <InCustody>  |
      | VictimContactScheme | No           |
    When PO requests an SPO to countersign
    And SPO visits the countersigning link
    And SPO countersigns after recording rationale in review
    And SPO requests ACO to countersign
    And ACO visits the countersigning link
    And ACO countersigns
    And PO logs back in to update Recommendation
    Then PO can create Part A
    And PO can download Part A
    And Part A details are correct

    Examples:
      | Indeterminate | Extended | TypeOfSentence | RecallType | InCustody  | SPODecision |
      | Yes           | No       | LIFE           | EMERGENCY  | Yes Police | RECALL      |
      | No            | Yes      |                | EMERGENCY  | No         | RECALL      |
